# Threaded Image Scraper

## Overview
The Threaded Image Scraper is a Python project designed to scrape and download images from two different websites: Unsplash and XKCD. This project demonstrates the use of threading to speed up the downloading process by performing tasks concurrently.

## Features
    Multithreaded Downloading: Uses Python's threading module to download multiple images simultaneously, significantly reducing the overall download time.
    Image Scraping: Scrapes images from web pages and saves them locally.
    Robust File Handling: Ensures images are saved with the correct file extension based on the content type. Creates necessary directories for storing downloaded images.
    Error Handling: Gracefully handles potential issues like missing image elements or network errors.
